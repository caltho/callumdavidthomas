        I am a Software Engineer who is passionate about the dynamic and
        fast-changing world of technology. I am dedicated to continual learning
        and practising agile methodologies and seek to be involved in useful and

        With a strong background in engineering and finance, I bring a unique
        perspective to the field of coding, combining my analytical mindset,
        problem-solving skills, and attention to detail to create efficient and

        When I&apos;m not coding you will find me practicing jiu jitsu, playing
        volleyball, or cycling around the city. If you would like to get in
